### Stuff in Space is a giftastic app that uses the GIPHY API, javascript, and JQuery to dynamically populate space-themed gifs on your screen at the click of a button!

## Using the App

The pictures on the top of the page are buttons dynamically generated with JavaScript and JQuery. 

![image_button](/assets/images//readMe/img_buttons.png)

Clicking on these buttons initiates a GIPHY API search for that item <b>IN SPACE</b>!
        
These picture-buttons are built into the app, but the user can also create their own buttons but using the "in space" input.

Type in what you want to put in space, then click on the generated button to see what Giphy has to offer! If you get overzealous with button creation (or just want to start over), simply click "nvm" and your buttons will be removed!

If you are done with your gifs, simply click on the "stuff in space" title at the top of the page and VOILA! You will reset your gif display!

## Behind the App

Calls to the GIPHY API are made with AJAX. Javascript and jQuery are used to manipulate the page! Styling is done with old-fashioned CSS and a bit of bootstrap.
