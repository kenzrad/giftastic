<b>Stuff in Space</b> is a giftastic app that uses the GIPHY API to dynamically populate space-themed gifs on your screen. 

### Using the App

The pictures on the top of the page are buttons dynamically generated with JavaScript and JQuery.

Clicking on these buttons initiates a GIPHY API search for that item <b>IN SPACE</b>!
        
These picture-buttons are built into the app, but the user can also create their own buttons but using the "in space" input.

Type in what you want to put in space, then click on the generated button to see what Giphy has to offer! on the page he GIPHY API is called with AJAX. and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.
